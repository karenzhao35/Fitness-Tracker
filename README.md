# My Personal Project

## Fitness System

### Features

This application will provide users with a platform to aid 
their fitness journey. Features of this program will
include:
- recording **calorie intake**
- recording day to day **workout sets**

This platform will be useful to anyone who would like to better manage
their macronutrients and execute progressive overload at the gym. I am 
passionate about this project because I believe recording reps and sets
can be very beneficial in ensuring consistency while resistance training,
and I have yet to find a system that I enjoy using. Thus, I would like to
create one!
